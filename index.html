        <h2>What is Parallax Scrolling Effect?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where background images
                    throughout
                    a web page move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional
                    site.It is one of the most used design techniques in web design right now, but also something you
                    probably donâ€™t even realize you have already experienced. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Parallax is based on optical illusion.Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as
                    larger than things
                    farther away,we perceive distant object as if they were moving slowly.The illusion has been long
                    adopted into parallax
                    across diffrent mediums,fostering a realisticcs effect.It's first use was in traditional animation
                    such as Disney's Snow White,Super Mario etc.With Advancements in HTML and CSS,parallax effects later
                    evolved into the world of Web Design we know today.

        <h2>Benefits of Parallax Effect in Web Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Parallax websites increase visual storytelling:</h3>
                <p>Users' attention span are getting shorter due to abundance of content available.Hence companies are
                    turning
                    towards visual storytelling.It holds the users' attention for longer and fosters a deeper connection
                    with your brand as it connects with the user on a different level due to it being visually appealing
                    and it can be an excellent way to
                    integrate storytelling into your website.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Parallax Websites reduce bounce rate:</h3>
                <p>Building a connection with the user using parallax effect(if executed properly) can reduce the bounce
                    rate.
                    Bounce rate refers to the rate at which the user navigates away from your website.Parallax Scrolling
                    naturally encourages users to continue scrolling and scanning the page down below the fold.</p>
