            <h2>What is Parallax Scrolling Effect?</h2>
            <p>Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where background images throughout
               a web page move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional
               site.It is one of the most used design techniques in web design right now, but also something you
               probably don’t even realize you have already experienced. </p>

            <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect</h2>
            <p>It is a simple motion that you are already accustomed to and it’s helped make many websites feel dynamic
               and interactive.
               If you choose to use it, it's important to brainstorm how parallax could also affect the mobile
               experience. To increase site speed and not infringe too much on mobile usability, it's typically advised
               to either reduce parallax scrolling or remove it entirely.</p>
